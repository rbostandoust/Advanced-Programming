They can become criminals if they do.<br>Some women from Ireland travel to England. They have legal abortions. Some women from Ireland cannot travel. They do not have the money.<br>This situation makes some Irish women angry. They want the UK’s law. They organise a group and they protest.<br>Difficult words: abortion (taking a baby out of a mother’s body when it is still too little to live), strict (extreme, harsh, “bad”), law (a rule that says what people must do or must not do).<br>You can read the original story and watch the video in the Level 3 section.<br>hala lalay lalay lalalaa la, in goone bud k intor shod :D<br>koko<br></p><p><span  id="1">police car</span></br></br>This news is about a young woman. She is 23 years old. She is driving. She is going too fast. The police stop her.<br>She has another problem. She has no driving license or insurance.<br>The woman does another bad thing. She drives into a police car. She injures three people. Two of them are policemen. One of them is the girl’s mother. The girl’s mother is in the car with her.<br>The young woman is in trouble now.
