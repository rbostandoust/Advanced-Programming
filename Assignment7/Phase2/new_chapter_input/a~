Women in the UK can have abortions. Women in Northern Ireland cannot. Northern Ireland has a strict abortion law. Women cannot have legal abortions there. They can become criminals if they do.

Some women from Ireland travel to England. They have legal abortions. Some women from Ireland cannot travel. They do not have the money.

This situation makes some Irish women angry. They want the UK’s law. They organise a group and they protest.

Difficult words: abortion (taking a baby out of a mother’s body when it is still too little to live), strict (extreme, harsh, “bad”), law (a rule that says what people must do or must not do).
